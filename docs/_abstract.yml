  **Background:**
  Networks have been used in different scientific fields to model complex
  systems. In medicine and epidemiology, drug prescription networks (DPN) have
  been proposed as a modeling tool for studying the temporal dynamics of
  medication co-prescription within a population.

  **Objectives:**  
  This study aims to assess the structural characteristics of temporal DPNs,
  derived from daily co-prescriptions between treatments for mental health
  conditions and other therapeutic drug classes. By analyzing these networks,
  particularly through eigenvector centrality, we can identify influential
  medications and uncover prescribing patterns indicative of polypharmacy.

  **Methods:** For exploratory time series analysis, and network
  construction, we utilized the IADB.nl database that collects
  prescriptions from 128 pharmacies in the Netherlands. A closed cohort
  with at least one prescription of anxiolytics/antidepressants dispensed
  anywhere from 2018 to 2022 was extracted. The drug prescription was
  evaluated daily using anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC)
  classification, where psychopharmaca was evaluated at ATC level 4, drugs
  for the nervous system at ATC level 3, and other medications at ATC
  level 1, distinguished into a total of 24 therapeutic medication
  classes. Symmetric daily dose-adjusted co-prescriptions were used to
  construct time-varying DPNs as undirected graphs. Subsequently,
  eigenvector centrality ($c_e$) was computed as a measure of relative
  nodal importance, which reflects the degree of medication concurrence in
  a network. The number of prescriptions ($n_c$), number of patients,
  claim-to-patient ratio, and eigenvector centrality were extracted as
  weekly-aggregated time-series data. Singular spectrum analysis was
  performed to decompose the data into its constituting trend, harmonics,
  and noise components.

  **Results:** Antidepressants (ATC `N06A`, $c_e$: 0.09, $n_c$: 28,993)
  and anxiolytics (`N05B`, $c_e$: 0.04, $n_c$: 14,061) are psychopharmaca
  with high eigenvector centrality. These classes of medication are likely
  to be co-prescribed apart from other medications. Further groups with
  high eigenvector centrality were medications for alimentary and
  metabolism (`A01-A16`, $c_e$: 0.21, $n_c$: 53,602), blood (`B01-B06`,
  $c_e$: 0.08, $n_c$: 13,310), cardiovascular (`C01-C10`, $c_e$: 0.19,
  $n_c$: 44,802), analgesics (`N02`, $c_e$: 0.05, $n_c$: 13,847), and
  respiratory (`R01-R07`, $c_e$: 0.09, $n_c$: 25,034). Among the seven
  medication groups with high eigenvector centrality, only antidepressants
  showed a positive time trend for both eigenvector centrality and actual
  number of claims.

  **Discussion:**
  Seven medication therapy classes, including three psychopharmaceuticals,
  exhibited high eigenvector centrality, indicating strong co-prescription
  patterns with other medication groups among antidepressant and anxiolytic
  users. Constructing a prescription network allows for a more detailed
  exploration of polypharmacy patterns, helping to identify influential
  medications and prescribing behaviors in this population. This approach
  serves as a filtering mechanism to pinpoint high-impact medications for
  targeted drug monitoring and improved clinical oversight.
