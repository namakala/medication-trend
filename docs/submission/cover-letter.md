**Dear {{< meta var.greeting >}},**

I wish to submit an original research article entitled "A temporal network analysis of drug co-prescription during antidepressants and anxiolytics dispensing in the Netherlands from 2018 to 2022" for consideration by *{{< meta var.journal >}}*. In this paper, we analyze temporal drug-prescription networks derived from daily co-prescriptions involving antidepressants, anxiolytics, and all other therapeutic drug classes dispensed in the Netherlands from 2018 to 2022. The data was a representative of the general population in Netherlands receiving at least one prescription of antidepressants or anxiolytics within the set period. Our research addresses the question: *"How does eigenvector centrality from network analysis help characterize polypharmacy patterns?"* The findings point to key co-prescription trends, providing data-driven opportunities for drug monitoring and regulatory attention.

We believe this manuscript is appropriate for publication in *{{< meta var.journal >}}* because it contributes novel methodological insights using network science to explore drug usage patterns in population data. The work aligns with the journal’s focus on non-communicable disease epidemiology, pharmaceutical use, and the application of statistical methods in public health. Readers interested in pharmacoepidemiology, mental health services, and data-driven oversight of prescribing practices will find the article especially relevant.

We confirm that this work is original, has not been previously published, and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have reviewed and approved the manuscript and its submission to *{{< meta var.journal >}}*. We have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Please address all correspondence to me at [a.l.m.lamuri.murdani@rug.nl](mailto:a.l.m.lamuri.murdani@rug.nl).

Thank you for considering our manuscript.

Sincerely,  
Aly Lamuri, PhD Candidate
