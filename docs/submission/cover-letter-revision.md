**Dear {{< meta var.greeting >}},**

Thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit our original research article entitled *"A temporal network analysis of drug co-prescription during antidepressants and anxiolytics dispensing in the Netherlands from 2018 to 2022"* (Manuscript ID: **{{< meta var.manuscript-id >}}**). We have carefully addressed the revisions requested by Reviewer 2, with particular attention to improving clarity, grammar, and overall language use throughout the manuscript. These edits were made to enhance readability and ensure that the presentation of the study is clear and precise, without altering the scientific content or conclusions. We hope that the revised manuscript will now be suitable for publication in *{{< meta var.journal >}}*.

We appreciate the time and effort invested by the editors and reviewers in evaluating our manuscript and thank you for considering our revised submission. We look forward to your response.
