\title{A temporal network analysis of drug co-prescription during
antidepressants and anxiolytics dispensing in the Netherlands from 2018
to 2022}
        
\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:} Drug prescription networks (DPNs) model the
temporal dynamics of medication co-prescription within a population.
Understanding these networks can provide insights into polypharmacy and
prescribing behaviors.

\textbf{Objectives:} This study assesses the structural characteristics
of temporal DPNs derived from daily co-prescriptions of antidepressants,
anxiolytics, and other therapeutic drug classes. By analyzing these
networks using eigenvector centrality, we identify influential
medications and prescribing patterns.

\textbf{Methods:} We utilized the IADB.nl database, including
prescriptions from 128 Dutch pharmacies (2018--2022). A cohort of
patients prescribed antidepressants/anxiolytics was extracted.
Medications were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
(ATC) system into 24 therapeutic classes. Time-varying DPNs were
constructed as undirected graphs using symmetric daily dose-adjusted
co-prescriptions. Eigenvector centrality (\(c_e\)) quantified relative
nodal importance. Weekly-aggregated data included number of dispensing
(\(n_c\)) and eigenvector centrality, which were decomposed using a
singular-spectrum approach.

\textbf{Results:} Antidepressants (\(c_e\): 0.09, \(n_c\): 28,993) and
anxiolytics (\(c_e\): 0.05, \(n_c\): 14,061) had high eigenvector
centrality, demonstrating frequent co-prescription. Other ATC groups
with high centrality included those for the alimentary tract and
metabolism (\texttt{A01-A16}), blood and blood-forming organs
(\texttt{B01-B06}), cardiovascular system (\texttt{C01-C10}),
respiratory system (\texttt{R01-R07}), and analgesics (\texttt{N02}).

\textbf{Discussion:} DPNs revealed key co-prescription patterns.
High-centrality medications highlight potential targets for drug
monitoring, such as identifying co-prescription trends that may warrant
evaluation for safety, appropriateness, or policy oversight. This
approach aids in identifying influential medications and refining
prescribing oversight.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The complexity of health-related phenomena has led to the growing
application of network analysis in medicine and epidemiology
\citep{Luke2007, Miglio2021}. Graph theory provides the mathematical
foundation for network analysis, offering an approach to study the
relationships among the entities of a complex system. The early
implementations of network analysis focused primarily on transmission,
social, and organizational networks. More recently, \citet{Cavallo2012}
introduced drug prescription networks (DPNs) to model population-level
drug prescription data. \citet{Bazzoni2015} formalized the term,
emphasizing its utility in understanding polypharmacy.

Psychiatric polypharmacy is defined as a patient with at least two
concurrent psychiatric medications \citep{Shrivastava2013}. With a
prevalence between 13-90\%, psychiatric polypharmacy manifests in five
categories, namely same-class, multi-class, adjunctive, augmentation,
and total polypharmacy \citep{Shrivastava2013}. Same-class polypharmacy
is the use of multiple medications from the same class. Multi-class
polypharmacy is the use of multiple medications from different classes
indicated for the same symptom cluster. Adjunctive polypharmacy is the
use of additional medications to treat side effects due to other
medications. Augmentation polypharmacy is the use of full-dose and
sub-dose medications from a different class for the same symptom
cluster. Finally, total polypharmacy is the overall number of
medications a patient uses, including those prescribed for multiple
psychiatric symptom clusters as well as for comorbid non-psychiatric
conditions \citep{Shrivastava2013}. For policymakers, differences in
defining polypharmacy pose a challenge to design an effective monitoring
system \citep{Sirois2016}. Such monitoring is essential to identify
prevalent co-prescription pattern that may impact treatment
appropriateness and healthcare policy development.

A DPN is a graphical representation where medications correspond to
nodes, and edges represent co-prescription relationships between them.
Typically, simple undirected graphs are represented by a square
symmetric adjacency matrix \(A\), where each nonzero element \(A_{ij}\)
indicates that medications \(i\) and \(j\) were co-prescribed on a given
day. A population-level DPN can be constructed by aggregating individual
patient networks through matrix addition \citep{Cavallo2012}. Analyzing
the structural characteristics of a DPN using both local
(medication-level) and global (network-level) graph measures provides
insights into co-prescription dynamics.

A DPN for an individual on a given day can be formalized as a simple
undirected graph where medications correspond to nodes, and edges
connecting pairs of nodes represent co-prescription relationships
between medications \citep{Cavallo2012}. Typically, simple undirected
graphs are represented by a square symmetric matrix with zeros on the
diagonal called the adjacency matrix \citep{estrada2012structure}. In
the adjacency matrix of the individual-level DPN, nonzero off-diagonal
elements correspond to two medications being co-prescribed on a given
day.

A population-level DPN on a given day can be constructed from
individual-level DPNs through matrix addition of the corresponding
adjacency matrices \citep{Cavallo2012}. A DPN at the population level on
a given day is then formulated as a weighted undirected graph, which is
characterized by a weighted adjacency matrix with weights equal to the
counts of medication co-prescription occurrences. Therefore, analyzing
the structural characteristics of a DPN over time using both local
(medication-level) and global (network-level) graph measures offers
valuable insights into co-prescription dynamics and can deepen our
understanding of polypharmacy.

Local network statistics, such as node centrality measures, quantify the
importance of a medication in polypharmacy patterns \citep{Askar2021}.
Addressing concerns about standardized polypharmacy indicators raised by
\citet{Sirois2016} and \citet{Delara2022}, we highlight eigenvector centrality
as a key measure of a medication's connection to highly prescribed drugs. In
this context, eigenvector centrality offers a useful descriptive measure
because it captures not only the number of co-prescriptions involving a
medication, but also the connectedness of the medications with which it is
co-prescribed. Medications with high eigenvector centrality are therefore
structurally embedded within densely connected prescribing patterns, reflecting
their position within broader co-prescription structures. Building on prior
studies \citep{Cavallo2012, Bazzoni2015}, this study focuses on eigenvector
centrality as a network-based indicator of structural connectedness in
co-prescription patterns, rather than as a direct measure of clinical
polypharmacy at the individual level. Specifically, we aim to assess the
structural characteristics of temporal DPNs derived from dispensing data, with
particular emphasis on identifying medication classes that occupy central
positions within co-prescription networks among adult patients prescribed
antidepressants or anxiolytics.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Source of data and study
population}\label{source-of-data-and-study-population}

All data in this study originated from the University of Groningen
IADB.nl, a dynamic pharmacy database containing prescription records
since 1994. The database covers approximately 128 community pharmacies
serving over one million patients and was accessed on the
20\textsuperscript{th} of September 2023. In the Netherlands, the
primary route of obtaining prescription medications is through community
pharmacies, as physicians issue prescriptions that are almost
exclusively dispensed in these settings. Consequently, the database
provides a comprehensive longitudinal record for each individual,
supported by high patient-pharmacy commitment. All patients are recorded
in the database, irrespective of health care insurance, where the
prescription rates, age, and gender are generalizable to represent the
Netherlands \citep{Visser2013}. Each record includes the dispensing
date, quantity, dose regimen, number of days prescribed, prescribing
physician, and the corresponding Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
code. Medication dispensed during hospitalization and over-the-counter
drugs are not captured, but prescription medication records in community
pharmacies are otherwise complete.

This analysis includes daily drug dispensing record from a static cohort of
adults aged 18 to 65 years and prescribed anxiolytics or antidepressants
at least once in the period 2018-2022. For this study, only a subset of
the database was used to construct the DPN: anonymized patient
identifiers, age, prescription start and end dates, and ATC codes. No
additional individual-level data were included to align with general
data minimization requirements. Other demographic or clinical
information available in the database was not extracted.

\subsection{Graph theory}\label{graph-theory}

Mathematically, a simple undirected graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is a pair
\(\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}\right)\), where
\(\mathcal{V} = \left(1, \dots, n \right)\) is the set of nodes and
\(\mathcal{E} = \left(\{i, j\} \ | \ i, j \in \mathcal{V}, \ i \neq j \right)\)
is the finite set of edges. The adjacency matrix
\(A \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times n}\) of a simple undirected graph
\(\mathcal{G}\) is a square symmetric matrix of dimension \(n \times n\)
defined as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-graph-theory}{
A_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if} \{i, j\} \in \mathcal{E} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
}\end{equation}

with elements \(A_{ij} = A_{ji}\), for all \(i, j \in \mathcal{V}\)
where \(i \neq j\) \citep{estrada2012structure}.

In our setting, drug co-prescriptions from a single individual \(p\) on
a specific day \(t\) are encoded in a simple undirected graph
\(\mathcal{G}^p(t)=\left(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}^p\left(t\right)\right)\)
with \(n \times n\) adjacency matrix \({A^p}\left(t\right)\). In these
daily observed individual-level networks, the node set \(\mathcal{V}\)
corresponds to a set of \(n\) medication classes according to the ATC
classification, and the edge set \(\mathcal{E}^p\left(t\right)\)
contains edges that indicate the concurrent use of pairs of medications
for a particular individual \(p\) on a given day \(t\).

\subsection{Data pre-processing to build the data
matrix}\label{data-pre-processing-to-build-the-data-matrix}

Assume an observational study where \(P\) individuals indexed by \(p\),
\(p=1,\dots,P\) are followed for each day \(t\), \(t=1, \dots, T\) for a
total period of \(T\) days. To derive the population-level DPN on each
day \(t\) with adjacency matrix \(A_t\), the individual-level daily
prescription matrices \(A^{p}\left(t\right)\) were aggregated by
computing their element-wise sum, that is,

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-DPN}{
\displaystyle \sum_{p=1}^P A^{p}\left(t\right), \ \text{where} \ A\left(t\right) \in \ \mathbb{Z}_+^{n\times n}.
}\end{equation}

The matrix \(A\left(t\right)\) captures the population frequency of
co-prescriptions (off-diagonal) and single prescriptions (diagonal) in
the data at the specified time \(t\). Each element \(A_{ij}\left(t\right)\) in the
matrix was interpreted as the number of patients being prescribed
medication classes \(i\) and \(j\), with \(i,j\in \mathcal{V}\), on the
same day \(t\).

The population-level DPN is then a weighted undirected graph
\(\mathcal{G}\left(t\right) = \left(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}\left(t\right)\right)\)
observed over \(T\) discrete time points \(t=1,\dots,T\), where: -
\(\mathcal{V}\) is the fixed set of \(n\) nodes, -
\(\mathcal{E}_t \subseteq \{ \{i, j\} : i, j \in \mathcal{V}, i \neq j \}\)
is the edge set at time \(t\).

The population-level DPN at time \(t\) is fully described by its
symmetric weighted adjacency matrix
\(A\left(t\right) \in \mathbb{Z}_+^{n \times n}\), which is defined as:

\[
{A}_{ij}\left(t\right) =
\begin{cases}
w_{t,ij} > 0 & \text{if } \{i, j\} \in \mathcal{E}\left(t\right), \\
0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\quad \text{with } {A}\left(t\right) = {{A}\left(t\right)}^\top.
\]

In the original work of DPN, all defined daily dose (DDD) were assumed
equal to 1, allowing for applying raw counts as the edge weights.
However, since not all medications have DDD = 1, this assumption could
lead to inaccurate representations. To enhance the accuracy of edge
weights, we introduced a weighting function to adjust the contribution
of each co-prescription. Specifically, each co-prescribed medication
class was assigned a weight \(\omega_j\) based on its DDD value using a
Gaussian kernel centered at the baseline weight \(\omega_B = 1\), i.e.,
the expected DDD, with standard deviation \(\sigma = \frac{1}{3}\) to
allow for a gradual reduction in weight as DDD deviates from 1.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-weighted-DDD}{\omega_j = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{\left(DDD_j - 1\right)}{2\sigma^2}^2}}\end{equation}

The edge weight between medication classes \(i\) and \(j\) was computed
as the average of their individual weights:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-regularize-mtx}{
\stackrel{\textrm{Unregularized}}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
  n_{1, 1} & \dots & n_{1, N} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  n_{N, 1} & \dots & n_{N, N} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
}
\quad \to \quad
\stackrel{\textrm{Regularized by } DDD}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\omega_1 + \omega_1 \right) & \dots & \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\omega_1 + \omega_N \right) \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\omega_N + \omega_1 \right) & \dots & \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\omega_N + \omega_N \right) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
}
}\end{equation}

This weighting approach scaled the edge weight that deviate substantially from
the standard \(\omega_B = 1\), improving comparability across medication
classes. Although diagonal elements capture single-class dispensing
frequencies, they were excluded from network analyses to avoid self-loops.
Because DDD represents a standardized population-level metric rather than
individual dosage, our weighting scheme was applied as a descriptive
adjustment.

\subsection{Centrality measures in graph
theory}\label{centrality-measures-in-graph-theory}

Centrality measures formalize the identification of important nodes in a graph
\citep{estrada2012structure}. Different node centrality measures quantify
different structural properties of a node. Previous work on DPNs highlighted
four centrality measures that could be used to assess the position of a
medication within a co-prescription network \citep{Miglio2021}. Degree
centrality in a DPN describes the number of co-prescription with the medication
of interest. High (low) degree centrality means the medication is often
(seldom) co-prescribed.  Betweenness centrality indicates the frequency of a
medication connecting two other medications by the shortest possible path. High
(low) betweenness centrality means the medication is (not) a ``bridge'' between
different kind of medications. Closeness centrality is the average distance
between one medication to all other medications in the DPN. High (low)
closeness centrality means that the medication is (not) commonly co-prescribed.
Eigenvector centrality reflects the number of co-prescription with medications
that have a prominent network position in the DPN. High (low) eigenvector
centrality means that the medication is often (seldom) co-prescribed with other
central medications.

The choice of centrality largely depends on the objective of network
analysis. As a general guide, degree centrality is useful to identify
popular medication and monitor drug overuse. Betweenness centrality is
suitable for targeting for drug-interaction study and optimizing therapy
plan. Closeness centrality indicates widely-used key medications and
efficiency in treatment networks. Eigenvector centrality is helpful to
identify influential medications and narrow down high-impact medications
for drug monitoring. We defined high and low eigenvector centrality
relative to the expected value \(C_e = \frac{1}{n}\), based on the heuristic
reference of uniform connectivity and unweighted network (see ``Determining relative importance'').
This study focused on eigenvector centrality to evaluate which
medications have a significant influence on the prescription of
antidepressants and anxiolytics. Equation~\ref{eq-eigen-centrality}
outlines the calculation of eigenvector centrality; \(c_i\) and \(c_j\)
are the centralities of nodes \(\mathcal{v}_i\) and \(\mathcal{v}_j\),
respectively, with \(i, j \in \mathcal{V}\); \(\lambda\) is the
eigenvalue; \(A_{ji}\left(t\right)\) is an element on row \(j\) and
column \(i\) from an adjacency matrix \(A\left(t\right)\), representing
the connection between node \(\mathcal{v}_j\) and \(\mathcal{v}_i\) with
\(i, j \in \mathcal{V}\).

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-eigen-centrality}{
\displaystyle c_i\left(t\right) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{j \neq i} A_{ji}\left(t\right) \cdot c_j\left(t\right)
}\end{equation}

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}

\subsubsection{Exploratory descriptive
analysis}\label{exploratory-descriptive-analysis}

The data was extracted as a daily time series and aggregated into weekly
and monthly intervals for analysis. It includes four metrics: daily
prescription dispensing, daily patients, dispensing-to-patient ratio,
and eigenvector centrality. For each metric, a univariate descriptive
analysis was performed, reporting the mean, median, standard deviation,
and interquartile range to summarize centrality and dispersion.

\subsubsection{Exploring seasonality in the
dataset}\label{exploring-seasonality-in-the-dataset}

Exploration on seasonality was done on detrended daily and weekly data
by generating seasonal plots and calculating the autocorrelation (ACF)
and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Seasonal plots were
generated for weekly and yearly pattern by using daily and weekly data,
respectively. To generate the seasonal plots, the data was first
deconstructed based on its period. For daily data, the weekly period was
used; while for weekly data, the yearly period was used. The weekly
period was obtained by creating an ordered value formatted as year -
week, e.g.~\texttt{2018\ -\ W01}. Similarly, monthly period was obtained
by creating an ordered value formatted as year - month,
e.g.~\texttt{2018\ -\ M01}. We then grouped the series by its
deconstructed period and visually examine seasonality as overlapping
pattern in most periods. To substantiate the findings, ACF and PACF
plots were used to check on statistical significance of a given pattern.

\subsubsection{Summarizing
co-prescription}\label{summarizing-co-prescription}

This study explored same-class, multi-class, and total co-prescription
categories. These three groups were selected as they can be directly
inferred from medication dispensing data aggregated at the population
level over the year. The statistics were summarized as prescription-day,
defined as the number of medications dispensed on a given day. For
example, seven medications prescribed for one day account for 7
prescription-days. The mean and standard deviation represented the
average number of prescription-days per person for any co-prescription
regimen.

Although five polypharmacy categories were described by
\citet{Shrivastava2013}, augmentation and adjunctive polypharmacy
require clinical context such as diagnoses to determine the rationale
for combined prescriptions, which is not available in our data source.
Therefore, focusing on the three categories that rely solely on
medication class information is the most reasonable approach for this
study.

\subsubsection{Decomposition with singular spectrum
analysis}\label{decomposition-with-singular-spectrum-analysis}

Classical and seasonal-trend decomposition techniques may not fully capture
complex periodic patterns in time-series data. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA)
is a non-parametric method that leverages Hankel matrix embedding for
decomposition. In this study, SSA was applied to descriptively identify trends
and seasonal components in weekly aggregated prescription data. First, a
basic SSA model with the lag parameter \(L\) = 52 was used to extract the
dominant trend. The residuals were then analyzed with a second SSA model using
\(L = \frac{N}{2}\) to capture complex periodic patterns. The extracted trend,
residuals, and oscillatory components were evaluated visually and
statistically, with Mann-Kendall trend tests applied to assess long-term
changes. A complete documentation of this approach and its rationale was
included in the supplementary file section S1.2.

\subsubsection{Determining relative
importance}\label{determining-relative-importance}

Since the sum of all normalized eigenvector centralities \(c_i\) in equation
\ref{eq-eigen-centrality} equals 1, the expected eigenvector centrality \(C_e\)
for each node in a uniformly connected network is \(\frac{1}{n}\), where \(n\)
is 24, representing the total number of nodes. In such a network, each node has
an equal probability of being connected to any other, and thus no node is more
``central'' than another. This expected value, \(\frac{1}{24}\), serves as a
baseline under a heuristic reference of uniform connectivity and unweighted
network. Nodes with \(c_i\) greater than \(\frac{1}{24}\) were categorized as
having high eigenvector centrality, and those below the expected value were
considered low.

\subsubsection{Subgroup analysis}\label{subgroup-analysis}

Subgroup analyses were conducted by first categorizing the population into two
age groups: \(< 65\) and \(\geq 65\) years \citep{Uddin2022}.  The second
categorization was based on general polypharmacy, defined a receiving \(\geq
5\) medications for at least 30 consecutive days
\citep{nicholson2024prevalence}. These subgroup classifications were combined
to form three comparison pairs: \(< 65\) vs.~\(\geq 65\) years;
non-polypharmacy vs.~polypharmacy; and the non-polypharmacy group aged \(< 65\)
years vs.~the polypharmacy group aged \(\geq 65\) years. Separate
population-level DPNs were constructed independently for each subgroup using
the same preprocessing and weighting procedures to calculate its respective
eigenvector centrality.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Description of the
population}\label{description-of-the-population}

IADB recorded 149,071 patients with at least one dispensing of
antidepressants or anxiolytics within five years of data extraction.
Table~\ref{tbl-overview-patient} captures the demographical dynamics of
the population from 2018 to 2022. The ratio of male to female only
varied slightly, and the average age steadily increased over the year.
These findings imply that the population demography stays relatively
stable overtime without any indication of sudden changes. Importantly,
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 did not substantially influence dispensing
volumes because the community pharmacy remained in service as a part of

\subsection{Cyclicality and seasonality of medication
dispensing}\label{cyclicality-and-seasonality-of-medication-dispensing}

Visual inspection of daily dispensing volumes revealed consistent weekly
cycles. Dispensing peaked on Monday, with an average of 7,222 {[}SD: 999.79{]}
and dropped to its lowest on Saturday, with an average of 2,808 {[}SD:
174.08{]} dispensing. The variation between weekends and weekdays showed a
regular and repeating structure in the data, as shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-overview-daily}. The cyclical patterns are detailed in the
supplementary material section S2.1.  Seasonality was explored as dependencies
at daily and weekly lags and further described in the supplementary material
section S2.2 and S2.3.

\subsection{Co-prescription in the
population}\label{co-prescription-in-the-population}

Table~\ref{tbl-res-poly} outlines the type of co-prescription in the
population and reports two statistics: the sum and the mean with its
standard deviation. The sum indicates the total prescription-days of
co-prescription within a year, and the mean with its standard deviation
represents the average number of co-prescription days per person. For
example, in 2018, same-class co-prescription of antidepressants occurred
for a total of 73,528 prescription-days across the population, with an
average of 0.06 prescription-days per person, interpreted as:

\begin{quote}
``For every 100 people treated with antidepressants, there were
approximately 6 days in total during which same-class co-prescription
regimens occurred.''
\end{quote}

While these average numbers per person may appear low, they are not
intended to reflect the absolute epidemiological importance of
co-prescriptions. Instead, prescription-days serve as a relative metric
to compare the extent of co-prescription across categories and over
time. For instance, Table~\ref{tbl-res-poly} shows that multi-class
polypharmacy generally exhibits higher prescription-day values than
same-class polypharmacy among individuals prescribed antidepressants.
Therefore, prescription-day counts should be interpreted in the context
of relative prescribing patterns, rather than as a direct indicator of
epidemiological significance.

\subsection{Time-series decomposition}\label{time-series-decomposition}

For brevity, Figure~\ref{fig-ssa} only depicts the decomposition result
of antidepressants dispensed over the years. SSA-based decomposition
separates the trend from its harmonics, as shown in the lower half of
the plot. The trend explains roughly 90\% of the variability, and
harmonics explain 10\%. The first two harmonics, F1 and F2, captured
most of the variability in a series compared to the rest of it. The
trend, F1, and F2 were used to reconstruct the time series. The largest
panel in Figure~\ref{fig-ssa} displays the reconstructed time-series
(green line) overlaid on the original data points (gray line).

Additional decomposition results for other medication classes are
presented in the supplementary section S2.4. Broadly antidepressants
exhibited a steady increasing trend over time, while anxiolytics showed
a gradual decline both in dispensing frequency and eigenvector
centrality. Notably, the decomposition made long-term directional
patterns more discernible across all medication classes, emphasizing the
utility of SSA in isolating interpretable temporal dynamics from complex
dispensing data. These decomposed trends provides the reconstructed data
for the subsequent analysis.

decomposition of antidepressant dispensing volumes 2018-2022. The SSA
separated the original time-series into the overall trend, residuals,
and 25 oscillatory components (F1-F25). The green line represents the
reconstructed time-series using the trend component, F1, and F2,

\subsection{Eigenvector centrality
measures}\label{eigenvector-centrality-measures}

Seven medication classes exhibited high centrality, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-hi-eigen} and Table~\ref{tbl-desc}. Notably, highly
dispensed medications generally had high eigenvector centrality,
consistent with the definition of eigenvector centrality in
Equation~\ref{eq-eigen-centrality}. However, this relationship was not
strictly proportional. For example, although antidepressants had a
higher number of prescription dispensed compared to medications for the
respiratory system (6,108,776 vs 5,492,900), they exhibited lower
eigenvector centrality (9.48e-2 {[}SD: 2.24e-3{]} vs 9.53e-2 {[}SD:
2.21e-3{]}). A similar pattern was observed for anxiolytics, which had
more dispensing than analgesics (2,644,309 vs 2,557,528) but lower
eigenvector centrality (5.25e-2 {[}SD: 4.13e-3{]} vs 5.84e-2 {[}SD:
3.94e-3{]}). These discrepancies show that higher centrality scores
capture more than just a high dispensing volume.

The distribution of eigenvector centralities exhibited a central peak at
intermediate values and heavy tails at both extremes, reflecting the
temporal fluctuations of node influence. This pattern arose from the
recursive nature of eigenvector centrality, where each node's importance
depended on the importance of its neighbors. Aggregating centrality
value over time captured the evolving dynamics of the network, where
nodes occasionally attained a relatively higher or lower centrality. In
contrast, the width of the distribution remained relatively stable,
indicating that many co-prescription connections persisted consistently
over time.

The eigenvector centrality patterns shown in Figure~\ref{fig-hi-eigen} also
highlight the distribution of several subgroups, each distinguished by color.
Most subgroup distribution largely overlapped with the general population,
represented by the gray density curves. However, two subgroups consistently
diverged from this overall pattern: the polypharmacy group and the subset of
polypharmacy patients aged \(\geq 65\) years. These subgroups exhibited higher
eigenvector centralities across four medication classes, indicating denser
co-prescription structures within these groups. In addition, the \(\geq 65\)
years subgroup showed elevated eigenvector centralities in three medication
classes, although its magnitude was smaller than that observed in the broader
polypharmacy population.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This network analysis of dispensing data in individuals using antidepressants
or anxiolytics revealed distinct population-level patterns. While same-class
co-prescription was more common among antidepressant users, multi-class
co-prescription predominated among those receiving anxiolytics. Notably, in
both groups, multi-class co-prescription was at least ten times more prevalent
than same-class co-prescription. Seven medication classes consistently
exhibited high eigenvector centrality, indicating that these classes occupied
structurally central positions within the co-prescription network. These
include medications for the alimentary tract and metabolism (ATC code
\texttt{A}), blood and blood-forming organs (\texttt{B}), cardiovascular system
(\texttt{C}), respiratory system (\texttt{R}), and analgesics (\texttt{N02}).
Importantly, high eigenvector centrality reflects structural connectedness
within the prescribing network, rather than clinical influence or treatment
intent. Medication classes with high centrality were frequently co-prescribed
with other highly connected classes, linking psychiatric and non-psychiatric
medications within broader dispensing patterns. Such central positioning likely
reflects the co-occurrence of psychiatric treatment with the pharmacological
management of chronic conditions and comorbidities, rather than specific
prescribing strategies directed at psychiatric symptoms alone.

The predomination of multi-class co-prescription among anxiolytics recipients
is consistent with the recommendations in the Dutch College of General
Practitioner (\emph{Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap}/NHG)
\citep{NHG2019Anxiety}. Specifically, the NHG guideline for anxiety disorders
advises short-term benzodiazepine use, limited to two to four weeks, as an
adjunct to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) during treatment
initiation. In contrast, the NHG guideline for depressive disorders recommends
initiating pharmacotherapy with a single SSRI and discourages the combination
of multiple antidepressants \citep{NHG2023Depression}. These findings are
consistent with evidence-based clinical recommendations and are unlikely to be
solely attributable to sampling or measurement artifacts.

Our findings also align with previous research showing that antidepressants and
anxiolytics are frequently co-prescribed with other medications
\citep{Shrivastava2013}, and that multi-class regimens contribute most to
psychopharmaca polypharmacy \citep{de2004polypharmacy}. Additionally, our study
offers a more granular view of these patterns by characterizing their network
properties. By distinguishing between same-class and multi-class
co-prescriptions and evaluating medication centrality, our analysis highlights
that certain medication classes consistently occupy central positions within
the prescribing network. These characteristics are consistent with the high
prevalence of multimorbidity in populations treated for depression and anxiety,
where associations between psychiatric conditions and chronic illnesses are
well documented \citep{qi2024longitudinal}. Conditions such as diabetes
mellitus, thyroid disorders, and asthma have been linked to an increased risk
of depression \citep{jang2024temporal}. The need for long-term pharmacological
management further drives co-prescription patterns.  Additionally, chronic
illness-related anxiety can contribute to heightened prescribing of anxiolytics
\citep{lebel2020health}. This underscores the interconnected nature of
psychopharmaca prescribing patterns and highlights the complexity of medication
management in these populations.

DPN complements traditional drug utilization analyses by capturing the
structural properties of prescribing behaviors. Beyond evaluating
individual drug utilization or basic pairwise co-prescriptions, DPN
provides a structural perspective by mapping the interconnections
between medications within a broader prescribing network
\citep{Bazzoni2015}. The network approach is a particularly useful
method for understanding complex prescribing dynamics, which allows for
the identification of central medication classes that influence
co-prescription patterns. The high centrality of certain medication
classes suggests they serve as critical connectors in treatment
regimens, providing the basis for further monitoring and evaluation.

By mapping the relationships between medications, DPN enables the detection of
patterns that would be challenging to observe through standard statistical
methods. For instance, the high centrality of certain medication classes
suggests that they occupy central positions within multi-class co-prescription
structures, potentially reflecting their frequent co-prescription in the
management of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditions. As such, network
analysis is a suitable approach for generating hypotheses for further causal or
predictive studies, which has also been thoroughly discussed by
\citet{Askar2021}.

We acknowledge several limitations in this study. First, data
aggregation at the population level resulted in the loss of
individual-level information, limiting interpretation to population
trends. Second, while the adjustment of weights based on DDD introduces
a novel element to the analysis, it is important to note that DDD values
are not always equal to one, as defined by the WHO ATC system. Our study
adopted a DDD-based weighting approach to refine network edges, aligning
with the recommendation of \citet{Cavallo2012}. The adjusted weighting
penalizes values deviating significantly from 1, reducing their impact
on the network. Future research should explore alternative weighting
techniques, such as patient-level dosage adjustments, to enhance network
precision.

Despite the limitations, our study demonstrates the utility of DPN as a
powerful, data-driven approach to analyzing medication dispensing data.
By modelling intricate co-prescription patterns, DPN filters medication
classes based on network properties, offering insights into prescribing
behaviors. These insights can reveal important trends in medication use,
which can be useful to pharmaceutical reviews and public health
monitoring. By capturing the complexity of drug prescription
relationships, DPN holds significant potential to improve
decision-making in both clinical and administrative contexts.

Future DPN studies on individuals using antidepressants or anxiolytics
should adopt a more fine-grained ATC classification to identify specific
medications driving co-prescription patterns within the currently
identified seven medication classes. A more granular approach could
reveal whether certain drugs disproportionately contribute to
multi-class co-prescription and whether these prescribing trends vary
across patient demographics or healthcare settings. Such insights could
refine our understanding of prescribing behaviors and inform targeted
interventions for optimizing medication regimens.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This study demonstrates the usefulness of drug prescription networks (DPNs) for
characterizing population-level co-prescription patterns among individuals
prescribed antidepressants or anxiolytics. We observed that multi-class
co-prescription regimens were substantially more prevalent than same-class
co-prescription, particularly among users of anxiolytics, consistent with
existing clinical practice guidelines.

By applying network-based measures, we identified seven medication classes that
consistently occupied structurally central positions within the co-prescription
network. These central positions reflect frequent co-prescription with other
highly connected medication classes and are indicative of broader prescribing
structures that integrate psychiatric treatments with medications commonly used
for chronic somatic conditions. Such patterns are consistent with the high
burden of multimorbidity in populations treated for depression and anxiety.
